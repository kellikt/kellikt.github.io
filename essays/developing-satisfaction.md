Every day I am surrounded by software: from using TheBus app on my phone to figure out how long I can lie in bed before I need to get ready to submitting assignments on Laulima at 11:58pm, and even when I’m settling down for the night and getting my daily dose of cute puppies on Instagram. Coming into my second year of computer science, I’ve always wanted to do something related to software engineering because I’ve seen how software has permeated our daily routine, infiltrating and altering most, if not all aspects of life. Just taking a glance through <a href = "https://trends.google.com/trends/yis/2018/US/">Google’s top searches in 2018</a>, we can see a snippet of what software, or even technology as a whole, has a part in: “How to vote”, “Keto diet”, “What is bitcoin”, “How to apply magnetic lashes”. Thirty years ago, I wonder if people could imagine relying on their big, old tech box to keep them politically active, help them lose weight, learn about alternative currency, or even to give them beauty tips. This technological revolution has fascinated me, and I want to be a part of it.

## Software and Its Implications Today 

One word that I think encapsulates software is “convenience”. Through voice recognition software and virtual assistants like Siri, typing something out on your phone is as easy as saying something out loud. When we were loaned iPads in middle school, I just remember my English teacher telling us, “If you don’t feel like typing it out, you can just turn on Siri to type it for you.” It’s a mixture of amazement and bewilderment that passes my mind when I think about how future students might not even have to use a pencil in class anymore. If I were working on the Siri development team, I’d be ecstatic, and probably annoy my friends trying to get them to ask Siri about the weather. All that being said, I think most people want to have a job that keeps them satisfied, something that gives them the drive to commit to working eight hours at minimum a day. For me, working on a project that provides a service to other people or improves on something we endure as a day-to-day inconvenience would be a huge motivation for me. Through this software engineering class, and future classes related to this subject, I hope to develop more technical skills to be able to contribute towards a meaningful and useful project.

## Is being a good programmer just about coding?

Yet, some of the skills that I hope to develop throughout this course and future ICS courses are not wholly technical. I could go on and on about how I could write more efficient code, be a better debugger, or even just improve in commenting on my code so that future me doesn’t get confused. However, I think some of the most important skills to learn are the interpersonal skills you learn through working together. Teamwork is such a generic word, but the individual parts of it - learning where you can fit in and contribute, planning out how different skill sets from your peers can mesh together, and figuring out how to resolve conflict - flesh out why this is a staple term for almost any job out there. I still have a lot of room to grow in these areas, so I’m excited for the opportunity to have a group project at the end of the semester to bloom and learn with my teammates.

To conclude, I’m interested in software engineering because of its potential to mold our daily life and change how we think about the world around us. Software engineering is something that I believe I can mold to my passions, and contribute towards a project that I can be proud of. Along my journey, I hope to work more towards not just improving as a programmer, but also as a teammate. I’m excited for the future, and hoping to make the best out of ICS 314!
