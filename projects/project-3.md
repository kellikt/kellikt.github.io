For St. Andrew’s Schools’ 150th anniversary, I, along with two other students, created a video showcasing St. Andrew’s Schools’ teachers and teaching practices. This project was for a filmmaking class, taught partially by volunteers from <a href= "https://www.hawaiiwomeninfilmmaking.org/">Hawaii Women in Filmmaking.</a>

In this project, I was involved in all stages of the video, from drafting scripts and storyboards, filming and interviewing teachers, students, and faculty members, and editing video in post-production. Through this experience, I gained substantial knowledge in both the process of filmography and the more technical details of creating aesthetic b-roll and interview videos.
